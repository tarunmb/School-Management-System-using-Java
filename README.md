# 🏫 School Management System (Java + MySQL)

## 🚀 Problem Statement

Managing academic operations — including student records, teachers, classes, exams, and marks — can become complex without a centralized system. Manual tracking leads to inefficiencies, data inconsistency, and administrative overhead.

This project implements a desktop-based school management system that centralizes academic data through a structured database-driven application.

---

## 💡 Solution Overview

The system provides an intuitive graphical interface that enables administrators to manage school operations through modular CRUD workflows connected to a MySQL database.

Core workflow:

User Interface → Application Logic → Database Operations → Structured Records

This architecture demonstrates practical desktop application design, database integration, and modular system organization.

## 🏗 System Architecture

1. User interacts with Swing/JavaFX interface
2. Application logic processes requests
3. JDBC connects to MySQL database
4. CRUD operations update persistent records
5. Data is reflected in the UI

Data Flow:

GUI → Java Logic → JDBC → MySQL Database
